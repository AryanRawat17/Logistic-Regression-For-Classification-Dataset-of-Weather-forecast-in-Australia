# Logistic-Regression-For-Classification-Dataset-of-Weather-forecast-in-Australia
‒ Developed a logistic regression model to predict rain probability based on weather features, achieving [insert metric, 
e.g., 90% accuracy or specific AUC value]. 
‒ Engineered and processed weather data, including temperature and wind direction, to improve model accuracy and 
interpretability. 
‒ Optimized model parameters using gradient descent, reducing log-loss and enhancing prediction reliability. 
‒ Evaluated model performance through confusion matrix, ROC curve, and calibration, ensuring accurate and reliable 
weather predictions.
